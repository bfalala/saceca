	c_MyCategory_MyProp
	'c' means category
	MyProp may contains '_', i.e. have a path.

3째) A property MyProp used in internal computations should be named:
	i_MyProp
	'i' means internal
	MyProp may contains '_', i.e. have a path.
	
4째) SERVICE DEFINITIONS ONLY
	Services can access properties from the provider and the consumer. Additional prefixes are used for names:
